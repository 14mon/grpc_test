GRPC in Microservice

https://medium.com/@haadbaig/using-grpc-for-communication-between-microservices-42997ee70ca1

Here are the key differences between gRPC and REST:

1. Protocol

• gRPC: Uses HTTP/2 as the transport protocol, which enables features like multiplexing, streaming, and header compression.
• REST: Typically uses HTTP/1.1, relying on its methods (GET, POST, etc.) for communication.

2. Data Format

• gRPC: Uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), a compact, binary serialization format, which makes it faster and more efficient.
• REST: Usually uses text-based formats like JSON or XML, which are human-readable but less efficient in terms of performance.

3. Performance

• gRPC: High performance due to binary serialization and HTTP/2 features (e.g., multiplexing, reduced latency).
• REST: Slower due to textual data formats and the lack of HTTP/2 optimization.

4. Streaming Support

• gRPC: Supports bi
